		dt#what-is-100devs
			h3 What is 100Devs?
		dd
			p 100Devs, led by #[a(href="https://leonnoel.com/" target="_blank") Leon Noel], is a diverse and inclusive online training program with thousands of participants. It's designed to transition individuals into full-stack software engineering careers. The program is completely free and requires no prior technical experience.
			p As Leon says, "#[em this is not a coding bootcamp, this is a how to get a job bootcamp]." Beyond teaching essential technical skills for full-stack development, the course uniquely includes training in networking, resume writing, job applications, interview processes, and freelancing. It's valuable for both beginners and those with technical skills who are seeking employment.
		
		dt#how-does-it-work
			h3 How does 100Devs work?
		dd
			p During active cohorts, live classes are streamed on #[a(href="https://www.twitch.tv/learnwithleon" target="_blank") Twitch] on Tuesdays and Thursdays, with office hours on Sundays. However, this schedule only applies when a cohort is in session. For self-paced learners or those joining outside of a live cohort, this site provides the recorded classes and necessary materials to progress through the program.
			p This site provides access to the 100Devs program materials, including class recordings from #[a(href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBf-QcbaigsJysJ-KFZvLGJvvW-3sfk1S" target="_blank") YouTube]. These resources are valuable whether you're following along with a live cohort or studying independently.
			p Homework, follow-along materials, and homework submission forms, originally available through #[a(href="https://leonnoel.com/discord" target="_blank") Discord], are provided here as well for easier access and study.
			p 100Devs is a self-directed program, and your progress depends on your engagement and effort. For additional support and community interaction, join the #[a(href="https://leonnoel.com/discord" target="_blank") Discord community] and follow #[a(href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23100Devs" target="_blank") #100Devs on Twitter].

		dt#how-do-i-start
			h3  How do I get started?
		dd 
			p There's nothing special you need to do, just start watching the classes and doing the homework. Prerecorded classes are on #[a(href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBf-QcbaigsJysJ-KFZvLGJvvW-3sfk1S" target="_blank") Youtube] and the follow along materials and homework assignments are available on the #[a(href="https://leonnoel.com/discord" target="_blank") Discord]. Tracking the classes and materials from Discord can be difficult, though, so I recommend you check out these community-made resources to make the process easier (there are a few others but these are the ones that are up to date):
			ul
				li This site!: I #[em believe] this is the most comprehensive option for tracking your class and homework progress, but if you don't like it for any reason, see the other options below. CommunityTaught includes slides, follow-along materials, and check-in links as well as direct links to relevant homework materials. Shows homework assigned/due for each class. As of Jan 15, 2024, this site contains all recorded streamed classes from the 2022 cohort.

		dt#am-i-too-late-next-cohort
			h3 Am I too late? When is the next cohort starting?
		dd
			p The first 100Devs cohort started in 2021, and the most recent one finished in 2022. There was no cohort in 2023, but Leon will announce on Twitter and Discord when the next one, expected in 2024, is ready to begin.
			p You have the option to start learning with the 2022 class materials right now. This can be a great way to prepare and get familiar with the program's structure. When the new cohort starts, you'll be ready and already have some background knowledge. Alternatively, if you prefer to wait for the live experience of the next cohort, that's perfectly fine too. The choice is yours, based on what suits your schedule and learning style.
			p Remember, the 100Devs community and the Catchup Crew on Discord are ready to support you, whether you start now or with the next live cohort. The resources are available for you to start learning at any time, giving you the flexibility to either dive into the current materials or join the new class when it begins.

		dt#will-the-content-be-deleted
			h3  Will the content be taken down at some point? Do I need to worry about losing access?
		dd
			p Leon has said he will keep the content up on YouTube permanently, and he's also looking into adding open source/open content licenses to everything.
			p The community-made resources are a little trickier, but most people have hosted their resources on free services that are unlikely to disappear (GitHub, Google Docs, etc). I am committed to keeping this site up as long as 100Devs exists. Keep in mind, while these community resources are helpful, they're not essential to the program.

		dt#where-are-the-missing-classes
			h3  Where are the missing classes and streams?
		dd 
			p A few classes aren't on YouTube as they weren't typical classroom sessions. They include special events or activities, such as networking nights and group project work. For these, it's helpful to connect with others in the Catchup Crew for similar experiences.
			ul
				li Class 17: Networking Night - Introduce yourself and get to know others.
				li Class 18: Project Night - Work on a group project of your choice.
				li Classes 42 &amp; 43: Welcome Back sessions after a long break.
				li Class 49: Catchup for Huntober Prep Work.
				li Class 59 &amp; 60: Covered more prep for Huntober.
				li Class 66 &amp; 67: These classes dedicated time to work on hitlists and 100 hours projects.

		dt#where-are-the-channels
			h3  I can't see all the channels on Discord! How do I get access to them?
		dd 
			p As part of joining the Discord, you need to accept the rules and choose your roles. See the #[a(href="https://discord.com/channels/735923219315425401/735925942559440997" target="_blank") #read-first] channel. If you are still having trouble you can ask for help by creating a post in the #[a(href="https://discord.com/channels/735923219315425401/1084683270337347625" target="_blank") #new-need-help] forum channel.

		dt#how-do-i-join-a-house
			h3  How do I join a house?
		dd 
			p Initially, the 100Devs program included different houses based on varying commitment levels. However, as the program grew in popularity, the house system was discontinued to better accommodate the expanding community.
			p All participants now have equal and open access to the program's resources, ensuring a unified and inclusive learning experience for everyone.

		dt#how-do-i-join-a-study-group
			h3  How do I find an accountability buddy or study group?
		dd
			p Check the threads in the Catchup Crew channel on Discord, every few weeks someone makes a new public study group for members who have recently joined. If there's no recent group, go ahead and make one and invite others to join!
			p There is also the #[a(href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oZRvtvaP6AF0sxAn4dMZoDgR0AEntQvR0zJhNTixNhc/edit#gid=0" target="_blank") Catchup Crew Google Sheet] to keep track of where people are in the program, but it requires people to manually update as they progress, so it may not be accurate.

		dt#how-do-i-make-anki-cards
			h3  How should I make my Anki cards? Is there any premade deck I can use?
		dd
			p #[strong First a word of warning: Make sure you are using #[a(href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/" target="_blank") Anki], #[a(href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ichi2.anki&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US" target="_blank") AnkiDroid], or #[a(href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ankimobile-flashcards/id373493387" target="_blank") AnkiMobile] (unfortunately this one is not free and Leon recommends using the web version of Anki instead), NOT Anki App. Anki App is a copycat that is not affiliated with the Anki project and is not compatible with it.]
			p What you add to your deck is a personal decision based on what exactly you need to review, but in general, you will want to use Anki for important things you might forget or that feel complex and you need more review of the concepts. A lot of the early code will become familiar quickly because you'll be using it so much. And some things you encounter will be used so rarely you can just look them up when you need them.
			p As for what to put on each card, try to keep questions and answers short and simple. Ideally each card should deal with exactly one fact/concept. Break up more complex topics into smaller pieces where possible. The type-in answer option is great for coding questions.
			p Once you get to Codewars, it's recommended that if you attempt a challenge and can't complete it after 20 min or so, you should check the solutions and add it to your Anki deck for review.
			p It is #[em highly, highly] recommended that you make your own Anki deck. Not only will it ensure that the questions and answers are customized to your needs, the process of making the cards is an excellent form of review in itself. If you use a premade deck, you're missing out on that learning opportunity.
			p Having said that, some people like to see what others have done just to get ideas for their own deck. A few resources are available:
				ul
					li #[a(href="https://github.com/mac-kenzie-lee/ankiDeckSE" target="_blank") Anki Deck SE]: this is not a deck specific to 100Devs, rather a template for more attractive cards that was made by a 100Devs member.
					li #[a(href="https://github.com/abhisheknage/100Devs-Anki-Deck" target="_blank") 100Devs Anki Deck]: this is a deck a 100Devs member shared. Again, I caution you to use it only for reference for how you might make your own cards.
					li #[a(href="https://github.com/curtisbarnard/BANKI" target="_blank") Banki Answers]: this one is not specifically for Anki, it's actually a template for filling out your Banki answers, with a completed version you can use for inspiration if necessary.

		dt#how-do-i-checkin
			h3  How do I check in?
		dd 
			p Each class has a check-in link that will take you to one of Leon's tweets. To check in, just like and retweet the tweet.

		dt#should-i-checkin
			h3  Should I check in on Twitter for classes that happened months ago?
		dd 
			p Absolutely. It's important to check in on Twitter for each class as you complete it, regardless of when the class originally aired. This check-in is a key requirement for those seeking work verification or a reference from Leon in the future.

		dt#whhere-are-the-checkins
			h3  Where are the check-in links?
		dd 
			p Currently the easiest way to find the check-in links is #[a(href="/class/all" target="_blank") the class listing] here on CommunityTaught, but you can also find most of them in #[a(href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/177Ls9QS5ryjPBi82cjDnbtse5Of0RFl8/edit" target="_blank") this homework checklist].

		dt#where-are-the-office-hours
			h3  Are the office hours videos still available?
		dd 
			p The office hours videos are deleted from Twitch after 60 days, so most of them are no longer available. A 100Devs member in the catchup crew did make a partial (unlisted) Youtube playlist of office hours they downloaded from Twitch, but it doesn't start from the beginning of the cohort and may not be updated any longer. You can find the link in the Catchup Resources thread in the Catchup Crew channel on Discord.

		dt#should-i-submit-homework
			h3  I'm doing all the homework, but should I submit it? Will anyone check it?
		dd 
			p Yes, you should submit it. No one is going to look at it and give you feedback, but as with checking in, it's one of the requirements for verification down the line. Do keep in mind that while your homework won't be checked when you submit it, there's a good chance someone will look at it if you ask for verification, to confirm you actually did the work.

		dt#where-are-the-solutions
			h3  I need solutions for XX homework. Where can I find them?
		dd 
			p Although there are a few solution files in Discord in the follow-along-materials channel, most homework does not have provided solutions. If you build something and it looks/works the way you want it to, you did it right. If you can't figure out how to get something to work, ask for help!

		dt#where-are-the-downloads
			h3 I am looking for the resources like the hitlist, sample resume, etc. Where can I download them?
		dd 
			p All the downloadable resources provided by Leon are available here on the CommunityTaught #[a(href="/resources/downloads") Downloads Page.]

		dt#can-i-skip-ahead
			h3  I already know XX. Should I start from Class 1? Can I get verified if I don't do all the classes?
		dd
			p #[em Definitely] watch class 1 and do the homework, even if you intend to skip ahead. #[em Learning How to Learn] is extremely important.
			p I personally think it's worth starting from the beginning, even if you have some experience already. If you decide to start from the beginning but some material is familiar, you can watch classes on 1.5x or 2x, or skip sections you don't need. But it's not necessary to do so, the choice is yours. You can still get verification if you don't do the early homework; Leon announced a clean slate in class 32, so anything you missed before that will be forgiven.
			p If you already know some topics well, you can skip the earliest classes. A popular entry point in that case is the #[a(href="/class/frontend-crash-course-super-review" target="_blank") Front End Super Review] after class 18 (#[a(href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkXLGS57MS4" target="_blank") Youtube]) or the #[a(href="/class/javascript-crash-course-super-review" target="_blank") Javascript Super Review] after class 34 (#[a(href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sRJYuaqoiI" target="_blank") Youtube]).
			p If you are only looking for job hunting/freelancing advice, you can skip most of the classes, but you won't be able to get verification. Classes relevant to job hunting:
				ul
					li #[a(href="/class/how-to-get-a-job") Class 68: How to Get a Job (Combines everything you need to know in one class. It's ideal for a quick yet thorough overview of everything essential for job hunting in tech.)] (#[a(href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZf6_ld9u9A" target="_blank") Youtube])
					li #[a(href="/class/networking-night") Class 9: Networking Night (includes tips on how to network)] (#[a(href="https://youtu.be/OaglXfjsBaE" target="_blank") Youtube])
					li #[a(href="/class/how-to-start-freelancing") Class 15: How to Start Freelancing] (#[a(href="https://youtu.be/68Li7ukgDKg" target="_blank") Youtube])

					li #[a(href="/class/how-to-prepare-for-thehunt") Class 48: How To Prepare For #THEHUNT] (#[a(href="https://youtu.be/2ObpRuvmT48" target="_blank") Youtube])
					li #[a(href="/class/one-project-that-will-get-you-hired") Class 56 &amp; 57: One Project That Will Get You Hired (100 Hours Project)] (#[a(href="https://youtu.be/zjxo_-wNZHE" target="_blank") Youtube])

			p These are the dedicated classes, but not the only ones that cover job-related topics. For other mentions, you can check the #[a(href="https://leonstreamscripts.herokuapp.com" target="_blank") searchable subtitles].

		dt#should-i-do-missed-checkins-and-homework
			h3  I missed some of the early check-ins or homework, do I need to go back and do them?
		dd 
			p Leon announced a fresh start in class 32, so anything you missed before then, you don't have to go back and do. However keep in mind that:
			ol
				li The course is completely free and takes a significant amount of effort on Leon's part
				li He asks you to check-in to help increase the reach of the course
				li The homework is your skills training, so even if you don't submit it you should still do it

		dt#how-do-i-get-verified
			h3  What exactly do I need to do for verification?
		dd 
			p The process for verification is currently being fine-tuned and is only available during specific periods, though this may change in the future. According to the criteria used in the previous Huntober event, Leon typically requests the following for verification:
			ul
				li Bio blurb
				li GitHub profile (make sure you've got your green squares)
				li Codewars profile (make sure you've got plenty of completed katas)
				li Screenshot of Anki deck (make sure you've been creating and reviewing cards)
				li Angellist profile
				li Portfolio
				li Twitter account (make sure you've done all the class check-ins)
				li Cover letter and cover email
				li Resume
				li Linkedin profile
				li Hitlist/Networking Sheet (These can be one document or separate. Leon asks that you do networking weekly, so your networking sheet should have an appropriate number of connections and coffee chats)
				li Binary Upload Boom group project
				li Information on a paid client (amount earned and website) OR organization you volunteered for OR approved pull request on open source project (must be a real contribution, not a 'first contribution' like fixing a typo)
				li A repo for the completed 100 hours project (for the first wave this was just the MVP but Leon has said that going forward you will need to have the project complete)
				li A link to your hosted 100 hours project, if available. (This may become mandatory once Leon has covered an alternative to Heroku)
				li And it's not mentioned on the Huntober form but make sure you've submitted all the homework from class 32 onward

		dt#how-do-i-finish-the-readings
			h3  I'm stuck on the readings! How do I get through them?
		dd
			p Some of the readings can be dense and everything you absolutely need to know is covered in class, but Leon assigns everything for a reason. The reading helps you get some familiarity with the concepts before Leon teaches them. And probably more importantly, on the job you will be required to read documentation, so you do need to get used to parsing technical language.
			p However, that doesn't mean you need to understand every single point that's covered. Read to get a basic understanding and move on. And if you're getting completely derailed by the reading and you've been stuck on it for weeks, move on and make a note to revisit it later when you're more familiar with the concepts.

		dt#can-i-skip-floats
			h3  I'm stuck on floats! Can I just use Flexbox and Grid instead?
		dd
			p Similar to the readings, Leon assigns everything for a reason. There is legacy code out there still using floats, because Flexbox and Grid weren't always well supported. You really should have at least a basic understanding of how they work.
			p And similar to the readings, don't spend too much time on floats. You probably won't actually use them all that much, and if you're stuck to the point you can't move on, it's better to take another look at them after you've learned more.

		dt#codewars-is-really-hard
			h3 I can't solve any Codewars katas! What do I do?
		dd
			p First of all, understand that this is common when you're just starting out. Codewars can be overwhelming and confusing at first, and you could go through many katas before you start to understand how to do them. That's completely OK!
			p The first thing you need to do, is don't just take whatever random suggestion Codewars gives you for your next kata. Make sure you are filtering and sorting them to get the easiest katas first. This link will take you to the codewars search page filtered for 8kyu fundamentals kata and sorted by most completed. If any kata on the list feels too difficult, scroll past it and look for ones that feel doable.
			p The second important thing you need to do is only spend 20 minutes trying to solve a kata. If you feel like you're close to the answer but can't quite make it, bookmark it and come back to try again in a day or two. If you feel like you're not getting anywhere with it, look at the solutions until your find one that you understand. Learn the process that was used, then close the solution and go back to the kata and do it again using the method you just learned (without looking at the solution). Add it to your Anki deck for study, and make note of it to come back and try it again after some time.

		dt#how-do-i-put-codewars-on-github
			h3  How do I put my Codewars katas on GitHub?
		dd
			p Create a private repository just for Codewars. The most common method is a to create a new file for each kata you complete, and paste your solution in it when you complete the kata.
			p For example, my directory structure looks like this:
				img(src="/img/resources/codewars-organization.png" alt="my codewars directory structure, organized by language then kyu")
			p Rufio (a member of the Stream Team) also has a video on her #[a(href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HazQz4qosR4" target="_blank") codewars workflow].

		dt#how-do-i-backdate-git-commits
			h3  I have old katas I didn't upload to GitHub. How do I backdate git commits?
		dd 
			p Rufio from the 100Devs stream team has two videos you can check out, one on her #[a(href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HazQz4qosR4" target="_blank") entire codewars workflow] and one on #[a(href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFRY6Gxw9EA" target="_blank") how to backdate commits].

		dt#how-do-i-get-private-repo-green-squares
			h3  How do I get GitHub green squares for private repositories?
		dd 
			p Go to your profile and find your contribution graph. In the top right, there is a dropdown that says 'Contribution settings'. From there make sure 'Private Contributions' is checked.
